# Node.js Overview

- Without a JS engine, JavaScript cannot run.
- Node.js uses Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- Node.js provides non-blocking I/O.
- **2010** – NPM was created so developers can contribute using small packages.
- **2011** – Windows support was added (Joyent + Microsoft).
- **2014** – A fork was created by Fedor and renamed to _io.js_.

## JavaScript on the Server

- JavaScript engines use C++ to run JS code (V8 is written in C++).
- V8 can be embedded in any C++ program.
- Node.js is a C++ program with V8 embedded into it.
- ECMAScript defines the standard rules that JS engines follow.
- We can create APIs on the server using Node.js.
- **V8 Engine + Node.js Features = JavaScript Runtime**
